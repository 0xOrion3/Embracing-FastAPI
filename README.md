# Working with FastAPI
Reviewing another way to create APIs within Python. FASTAPI is a great framework that allows devs to build APIs faster than other frameworks. For this project I am following the tutorial provided on the front page of FASTAPI site.

Resource Link: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/

### Installation
pip install fastapi
pip install uvicorn (  ASGI server, for production)

## To Run API

uvicorn main:app --reload
